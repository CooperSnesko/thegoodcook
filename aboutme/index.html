  <p>Hi, my name is Cooper Snesko. I am currently getting my degree in software engineering. The dream career that I would like is to get a job with the FIA (Federtion internationale de l’automobile)</p>
    <p>I am 19 years old and not married. The advantage I see from learning about web design is getting more comfortable with coding which will help me in the future. I have been a member of the church my whole life and my favorite quote by a church leader would be “We did not come to earth to gain worth brought it with us”-Ardeth G Kapp.</p>
